# Application

I would love to work on this project, I am pretty familiar with Minecraft, although it's been awhile since I played anything other than modded versions. I would be very happy to be working on this project at an accelerated rate. I have experience on Front End and Back End. I have worked on full stack projects for the last two and half years at my job. Back end I use mostly Java, but am very familiar with Node/Express as well. Front End I am most used to Vue, but again am very familiar with React. If you're interested in letting me help with this project email me at brian@holderness.net.

## BOLTS:

- Business:
    - I think that the current business plan is the smartest option. I definitely think that most of the revenue would have to be through ads and donations. A yearly fee or service would have to be a good incentive.
- Operation:
    - All those positions seem to be correct, an additional role for a sales/advertising personal would probably be beneficial as well.
- Legal:
    - Yep, LLC in Utah.
- Technical:
    - Priorities seems to be correct, and maybe consider frameworks to use on top of the languages that are decided.
- Social:
    - Word of mouth and possible using ads on other Minecraft focused sites.
