# Application

I am interested because I play minecraft. It seems like the data we need and the tables we would make are clear and structured.. I would be happy to work in whatever languiges this team desides to use. Please contact me at chickencoop147@gmail.com

long live the chickens!

## Bolts
- Business
   - I agree. I also think that at some point it should be hooked up to a mod so that you can see the lists in game.
- Operation
   - If this gets to be to much to handle for the founders, we should sell it to someone else.
- Legal
   - I know nothing.
- Technical
   - Adding onto implementing: We'll want to gather all of the data as far as all the recipes and we'll have to decide how to calculate things when a particular block can be made multiple different ways.
- Social
   - start the word mouth campain by getting youtubers to use it for themselves and to be suplimentary to tutorial videos
