# Application

I would be interested in working on this project because I used to play Minecraft growing up and it would be fun to have a project working in the game again. I've seen something similar for Factorio (another game that I quite enjoy) and it was not only helpful to have the data as far as planning but it is also cool to have cool facts to see how many resources a particular build took. I've had experience working with postgres and with mongodb. But I also have experience with cloud tools including AWS EC2 servers, S3, and various web technologies including React, Vue, and Angular. I also have experience with Nodejs. If you would be interested in letting me work on this project please feel free to email me at corban@corbanha.com

## Bolts
- Business
   - I think your business idea is great for the Minecraft app. Just a thought: potentially a business opportunity building off of this app would be actually using this in industry. I could see it being really helpful for businesses who are actually manufacturing products to help with knowing how much raw inventory to purchase etc.
- Operation
   - These positions look good, potentially we could get some community involvement as well to help with bug finding, etc.
- Legal
   - And if you legit want a Utah LLC I have experience I have a couple Utah LLC's that I've created personally
- Technical
   - Adding onto implementing: We'll want to gather all of the data as far as all the recipes and we'll have to decide how to calculate things when a particular block can be made multiple different ways.
- Social
   - Word of mouth will be the best at first, also posting on forums and perhaps we could get some advertising on popular Minecraft servers or get popular Minecraft YouTubers to showcase the app
